> When you have to add a feature to a program but the code is not structured in a convenient way, **first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature**, _then add the feature_.

### The First Step in Refactoring

> Before you start refactoring, make sure you have a solid suite of tests. These tests must be self-checking.

> Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so if you make a mistake, it is easy to find where the bug is.
